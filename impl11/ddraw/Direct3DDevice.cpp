 * Yup, you-know-who again says:

	void Xwa3dRenderEngineGlow( Ptr<S0x042DB60> A4, int A8, Ptr<XwaTextureSurface> AC, unsigned int A10, unsigned int A14 )
*/

/*
From you-know-who:

The function to create lights for backdrops look like that:
// L00439040
void XwaCreateGlobalLightsForBackdrops(  )
{
	dword ebx = s_XwaPlayers[s_XwaCurrentPlayerId].Region;

	for( dword edi = 0; edi < s_XwaBackdropsCountPerRegion[ebx]; edi++ )
	{
		if( s_XwaBackdrops[ebx * 0x20 + edi].ColorIntensity <= 0.0f )
			continue;

		XwaAddGlobalLight(
			s_XwaBackdrops[ebx * 0x20 + edi].WorldX / 256,
			s_XwaBackdrops[ebx * 0x20 + edi].WorldY / 256,
			s_XwaBackdrops[ebx * 0x20 + edi].WorldZ / 256,
			s_XwaBackdrops[ebx * 0x20 + edi].ColorIntensity,
			s_XwaBackdrops[ebx * 0x20 + edi].ColorR,
			s_XwaBackdrops[ebx * 0x20 + edi].ColorG,
			s_XwaBackdrops[ebx * 0x20 + edi].ColorB
			);
	}
}

Before the call to XwaCreateGlobalLightsForBackdrops the global lights count is set to 0.
The lights are created in the same order as the backdrops appear in the mission tie file.
In the XwaTieFlightGroups array you can get the PlanetId.
For backdrops the CraftId is CraftId_183_9001_1100_ResData_Backdrop.
With the PlanetId you can read the backdrop model index in the XwaPlanets.
With the model index you can read in the ExeObjectsTable the backdrop dat GroupId and ImageId.

/*
From Jeremy, regarding LODs and how to parse the OPT structure:

There is no direct way to tell which lod is rendered.
There is int& s_XwaOptCurrentLodDistance = *(int*)0x007D4F8C;.
There is float& s_XwaFlightLod = *(float*)0x00600288;.
The distance is 1.0f / ( s_XwaOptCurrentLodDistance * s_XwaFlightLod );
You can access to the whole opt structure via a model index.
The SceneCompData struct contains a pObject member. The XwaObject has a model index.
At offset 0x007CA6E0 there is an array s_XwaOptModelFileMemHandles of 557 short. The index in this array is a model index.
There are these function to lock and unlock the handle.
// L0050E2F0
void* Lock_Handle( short A4 )
// L0050E350
void Unlock_Handle( short A4 )

The data struct of the locked handle is a OptHeader pointer.
With this header you can access to the whole opt.

/*
From Jeremy, regarding how to replace the transform matrix in MobileObject

The function to recalculate the forward vector is:
// L0043FFB0
void XwaRecalculateForwardVector( word A4, word A8, Ptr<XwaObject> AC )

The function to recalculate the transform matrix is:
// L00440140
void XwaRecalculateTransformMatrix( word A4, word A8, Ptr<XwaObject> AC )

I think you can modify/replace the implementation of this function to define the matrix to whatever you want

craftInstance->CockpitInstrumentStatus damage bits:

 0x0001 is the CMD/Targeting computer.
 0x000E is the laser/ion display. Looks like all 3 bits must be on, but not sure what happens if the craft doesn't have ions
 0x0010 is the beam weapon
 0x0020 is the shields display
 0x0040 is the throttle (text) display <-- This matches the code that Jeremy provided (see m181 & 64 below)
 0x0180 both sensors. Both bits must be on, if either bit is off, both sensors will shut down
 0x0200 lasers recharge rate
 0x0400 engine level
 0x0800 shields recharge rate
 0x1000 beam recharge rate

Yes, the cockpit instrument damages seem to be at offset 0x17F and 0x181 in the craft struct. I don't know how to interpret these values.
But for the craft components damages, there is:
In XwaCraft struct:
 0x01F7  Array<byte, 11> DamageAssessmentsOrder;
 0x0202  Array<word, 11> DamageAssessmentsPercent; // 100 = not damaged
 0x0218  Array<word, 11> DamageAssessmentsTimeRemaining;

enum DamageAssessmentEnum : unsigned char
{
	DamageAssessment_Engines = 0,
	DamageAssessment_FlightControls = 1,
	DamageAssessment_CannonSystem = 2,
	DamageAssessment_ShieldSystem = 3,
	DamageAssessment_TargetingComputer = 4,
	DamageAssessment_WarheadLauncher = 5,
	DamageAssessment_BeamSystem = 6,
	DamageAssessment_Communications = 7,
	DamageAssessment_Countermeasures = 8,
	DamageAssessment_Hyperdrive = 9,
};

Also, from the "how to get the value of the throttle question", we know that offset 0x181
seems to behave like a bitfield:

if ((ebp20->XwaCraft_m181 & 64) != 0)
	<display throttle>

HOW TO CREATE A SIMPLE TRACKER (from user BenKenobi, I think):

https://forums.xwaupgrade.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=12551&p=166877&hilit=opentrack#p166877
To add to that, You can also use Opentrack with an Aruco Marker. In that way all you need
is a webcam and a piece of paper! I’m testing this while waiting for IR leds to arrive and
the results are amazing!

I found a video on this on the internet while waiting for the IR leds and thought I’d give
it a go, didn’t even print the Aruco Marker, just used a piece of paper and used a black
Edding marker to make it.

See the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajoUzwe1bT0

I do use it with a PS 3 Eye camera, tried others but the Eye camera perfoms the best, it’s
not the resolution that’s important but the frame rate.

Justagai:

The cockpit camera position is in the CraftDefinition struct/table. Table starts at 0x5BB480
and offsets (2 bytes) 0x238, 0x23A and 0x23C for the cockpit Y, Z and X positions. This is per
craft by the way and that's how MXVTED read/writes them.

EDIT: Actually I suspect the player's current cockpit position might be stored on the 
PlayerDataTable in offsets (4 bytes) 0x201, 0x205 and 0x209. But I'm not entirely sure.

Jeremy:

The cockpit position is stored in offsets 0x20D, 0x211, 0x215 (of the PlayerDataTable)
After it has been transformed with the transform matrix in the MobileObject struct (offset 0xC7),
the transformed position is stored in offsets 0x201, 0x205, 0x209.

FOV

For 1920x1080:

HUD scale:
value: 1080 / 600.0f = 1.8

FOV:
value: 1080 * 1.0666f + 0.5f = 1152
angle: atan(1080 / 1152) * 2 / pi * 180 = 86.3�

focal_length = in-game-height * 1.0666f + 0.5f
angle = atan(in-game-height / focal_length) * 2

The formula for the angle becomes:
	focal_length = in-game-height / tan(angle / 2)

This is my default focal_length for 2560x1920 in-game: 1600x1200:
	focal_length = 1280.0
The formula above yields 1280.42, close enough
	angle = atan(1200 / 1280) * 2 = 86.3


The above becomes:
in-game-height / focal_length = tan(angle / 2.0)
focal_length = in-game-height / tan(angle / 2.0)

************************************************************************************************************

HANGAR

You can get the hangar object index via this variable:

// V0x009C6E38
dword& s_V0x09C6E38 = *(dword*)0x009C6E38;
When the value is different of 0xFFFF, the player craft is in a hangar.

With that index, you can get the object, mobile object and craft structs. From that, you can get the orientation of the mothership.
You can get the hyperspace phase with the craft state offset (00B).

				   away with all these flags.

				   The sequence of events goes like this:
					  - Draw the Skybox with ZWrite disabled, this is done in the first few draw calls.
					  - Draw 3D objects, including the cockpit (this is now done in the D3dRenderHook)
					  - Disable ZWrite to draw engine glow and brackets.
					  - Disable ZWrite to draw the GUI elements.
					  - Enable ZWrite to draw the targeting computer HUD.
					  - Enable ZWrite to draw the targeted 3D object.

					NOTE: "Floating GUI elements" is what I call the GUI elements drawn along the bottom half of the
						  screen: the left and right panels, the main targeting computer and the laser charge state.
						  I call these "Floating GUI elements" because they are expected to "float" before the cockpit
						  or they will just cause visual contention. The rest of the GUI (radars, HUD, etc) is not in
						  this category -- I just call them GUI.
						  Floating GUI elems have their own list of CRCs independent of the GUI CRCs

					At the beginning of every frame:
					  - g_bTargetCompDrawn will be set to false
					  - g_iFloating_GUI_drawn_counter is set to 0
					  - g_bPrevIsFloatingGUI3DObject && g_bIsFloating3DObject are set to false

					We're using a non-exhaustive list of GUI CRCs to tell when the 3D content has finished drawing.

		LaserLinkStatus goes 0x1, 0x2, 0x3 and 0x4. There's single fire, dual fire, current group fire and all groups fire.
